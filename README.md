# Python-Database-project
Python program that simulates a student registration system with the data stored on a MySQL server.
In order to run this project, first start your database and load in the students_courses_schedule.sql file.
In my implementation I chose to use a MySQL database. Once the data is loaded, enter your credentials to log in to your database through the python connector.
Once these prerequisites have been met the code should run smoothly and you can interact with the simulator.
